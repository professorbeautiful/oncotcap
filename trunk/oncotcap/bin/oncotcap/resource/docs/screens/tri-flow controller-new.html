The Tri-Flow Controller allows the user to configure the Onc Browser Tree <i>perspective</i>. The tree controller can be a powerful search and organization tool.
A user can select a single root node and one or more leaf nodes to display in the tree. 
<ul>
<li>To select a root node click on a modelling object label (i.e. Statement Template, Information Source, etc.). A white arrow to the left of the label indicates root node. </li>
<li>To select leaf nodes click on the the small squares to the right of the labels. A small icon with the modelling object abbreviation indicates that leaf node is selected.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Below are some examples of how to harness the power of the Controller.</h3>
<h3>Model Catalog </h3>

<li>Use the tree as a Catalog to see what ideas have been modeled. 
See Statement Bundles, Model controllers, Edicts that are already available for your use.
<ol>
<li>Select Keyword as the root node.</li>
<li>Select StatementBundle, Model Controler and/or Edict as leaf nodes</li>
</ol>
<pre>Note: 
At this point you may also want to use the filter to show 
only keywords that have one of the selected objects connected to it.
Click and drag the label from the Tri-Flow Controller into the 
Filter Tree, one at time. Press the Filter On toggle button on the 
OncTree Button Panel to the right of the tree.</pre>

<h3>Thought Experiments</h3>
Use the OncBrowser and Tri-Flow Controller to support various "thought" experiments. Using this tool, a modeler should be able to create and modify several thought experiments and see the results of their changes in a short period of time. Start from an existing concept and try variations on a basic theme. The user may start by looking at all the existing Model Controllers to see what concepts they implement. 
 <br>
 <ol>
 <li>Select ModelController as the root node. </li>
 <li>Select SubModel Groups or Edicts as leaf nodes.</li> 

<img src="../images/mc-sg1.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<li>Next Find a Model Controller that implements some of the concepts that you are interested in.</li>
<li>Copy the model Controller.</li>
<li>Add SubModel Groups ( new or existing) to modify the experiments</li>
<li>Re-run the model. and observe the changes. </li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
<li><h3>Supports Traceability</h3></li> 
Use Oncotcap to help capture the source information used to build a given model. When the OncoTCap three workflows are utilized fully, the user creates a self documenting Model. The user can quickly see for their experiment, what documentation exists to support the modelling concepts. A user may also see how the builder of the edicts interpreted the documentation and possibly how the builder assessed the relevance or confidence in the underlying source information used. 
<ol>
<li>Select Model Controller as root. </li>
<li>Select Interpretation, Knowledge Nugget and Information Source as leaf nodes. </li>
</ol>
</ul>
