<h1>The BAX apoptosis model</h1>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable --> 
<hr>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="OverviewBody" --> 
<p>This elementary model demonstrates a few capabilities of OncoTCap 4.</p>
<p>On the next screen is a schematic of the key Statement Bundle, how it is based 
  on a Statement Template, and how the parameter editor assists with specifying 
  the functional state of the apoptosis mechanism.</p>
<p>On the following screen (the &quot;editor&quot;), the model is built by choosing 
  statement bundles on the left and if desired editing the parameter values by 
  clicking on the parameter names in the central column.</p>
<p>Of interest is that the activity of the mechanism depends on a functional p53 
  product, which is represented as a <a href="../../screens/CategoriesAndCharacteristics.html">Characteristic</a>, 
  &quot;p53_functionality&quot;. Note that p53_functionality is NOT an identifying 
  Characteristic of the particular cell type, and could change as temporary conditions 
  change, such as the presence of treatments, orsignals from neighboring cells. 
  Many additional statements could be added to account for a variety of causes 
  for the disabling of p53 function. In this case, p53_functionality depends only 
  on the presence of at least one WT (wild-type) allele. </p>
<p>Two types of mutations of p53 are implemented. The first is an allele-level 
  mutation, expressed in the statement: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For gene&nbsp; <span class="parameterLink">p53</span> 
  , the WT allele can mutate to a&nbsp;MUT allele with mutation rate <span class="parameterLink">1e-4</span>.&quot;</p>
<p>represents a packaging of the pair of model assumptions, that WT-WT -&gt; WT-MUT 
  can occur, and that WT-MUT to MUT-MUT can occur, and that WT -&gt; MUT can occur. 
  The first mutation rate is twice the second, since there are two target alleles. 
  This is powered by two supporting statement bundles; to see how, go back to 
  the <a href="../../screens/OncBrowser.html">Browser</a> and trace the connections 
  back through <a href="../../overview/instructionmapping.html">SB's, ST's, and 
  CB's.</a></p>
<p>The second mutation is loss of heterozygosity, and is expressed in the statement:</p>
<p>Again, the transition WT-WT to WT happens with twice the frequency of WT-MUT 
  to WT.</p>
<p>While these statements can applied to any gene, they cannot in one step be 
  applied to all genes in the model. OncoTCap does not currently have an ontology-based 
  rule engine. This is a problem that will be solved with integration with the 
  caBIG &quot;Enterprise Vocabulary Services&quot;.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the two mutation types can exist independently, and 
  can also be combined. This is because two different Level Lists for a single 
  Characteristic (in this case, the gene) are combined by taking the set union.
