<p>"Oncology Thinking Cap" (OncoTCap) is a unique computer software environment 
  presenting a browser environment through which cancer researchers can "travel" 
  to investigate knowledge, concepts, and working simulation models without need 
  of a computer scientist for a guide. OncoTCap is a platform-independent computer 
  program for integrating cancer knowledge acquisition with model-building, to 
  facilitate a wide array of applications in research and education. Some examples 
  are: </p>
<p>&#8226; To facilitate the work of people with diverse skills and goals, so 
  that individuals doing cancer modeling can work together effectively within 
  teams. (The Tri-flow)<br>
  &#8226; To use natural scientific language to represent and re-use biological 
  and clinical ideas. (Statement Templates, Query Templates)<br>
  &#8226; To incorporate an expanding set of knowledge acquisition helpers (EDGAR; 
  caBIO; InsightLink).<br>
  &#8226; To facilitate use of other modeling engines besides the native simulator. 
  (Projects of the CViT Integrated Cancer Biology program; NetLogo; many others)<br>
  &#8226; To facilitate combining models of different sub-processes, from different 
  teams and even using different engines. (Sophisticated model representation 
  format and pre-processor.)<br>
  &#8226; To foster creative thinking by &#8220;iconoclast support&#8221;, that 
  is by making the catalog of modeling statements rich enough to remove restrictions 
  on hypotheses that might be entertained. (Statement Templates)<br>
  &#8226; To automate self-documentation tracing the decisions and information 
  sources feeding into model-building.<br>
  &#8226; To support modelers in acquiring data and sharing results.<br>
