<p><strong><font size="+3">A</font></strong> <em><strong>Domain experts</strong></em>: 
  The knowledge acquisition work flow (top-most spur in Fig 1) supports finding 
  and recording &#8220;InformationSources&#8221;, acquiring and assessing &#8220;KnowledgeNuggets&#8221; 
  from the Information Sources, attaching free-text &#8220;Interpretation&#8221;s 
  to these Knowledge Nuggets, and constructing free-text Edicts which convert 
  an Interpretation, which is declarative in nature, into imperatives suitable 
  for building models. (There is an important discipline to converting what appears 
  to be a hypothesis into an imperative form, to be sure that the hypothesis is 
  really saying something.).<br>
  <strong><font size="+3">B</font></strong> <strong><em>model-representers</em></strong>: 
  The code-mapping work flow (lower left) begins with the Edict. It involves searching 
  a catalog of &#8220;StatementTemplates&#8221; each of which represents a simple 
  or composite idea as a sentence or paragraph with &#8220;blanks&#8221; or Parameters. 
  Then one &#8220;fills in the blanks&#8221; of the selected Statement Template 
  with parameter editors, to create a Statement Bundle (which bundles a Statement 
  Template with a Value Map). Alternatively, a new Statement Template is constructed 
  using a powerful recursive idea-packaging methodology. Ultimately each Statement 
  Template is tied to a set of agent-based implementation descriptions called 
  Code Bundles, which are computer-language-independent. <br>
  <strong><font size="+3">C</font></strong> <em><strong>application-builders</strong></em>: 
  The application building work flow (lower right) involves successively grouping 
  selected Edicts to create &#8220;SubModels&#8221;, &#8220;SubModelGroups&#8221;, 
  and finally &#8220;ModelControllers&#8221;. A ModelController contains specifications 
  for auto-generating a specific modeling application, such as validation suite 
  testbeds, treatment optimization routines, and patient simulators for professional 
  training. From a selected ModelController, a Launch button automatically generates 
  and runs a new application program. In the application program, once the user 
  makes final model selections, a Run button causes a model to be computed. That 
  is, a pre-compiler writes Java source files, which are compiled, and finally 
  the simulation or calculation is begun.</p>
<p><br>
  The reason for the three work flows is that different backgrounds, skills and 
  motivations are required for the work of domain experts (A), model-representers 
  (B), and application-builders (C). (Although this description implies a directionality 
  to each work flow A, B, and C, in fact one can work beginning anywhere in the 
  diagram and proceeding in any direction.)</p>
<p> The design carefully respects how researchers work and the ranges of skill 
  sets they come with. OncoTCap supports separate but intersecting work processes, 
  dividing "labor" by expertise type and interests.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Gathering and managing knowledge, </li>
  <li>Expressing hypotheses and experimental designs as model-driving "edicts", 
    in biomedical language, </li>
  <li>Mapping edicts to abstract representations, using a catalog of model-driving 
    statement templates which follow the normal use of scientific language, </li>
  <li>Creating the working model code behind each statement template, </li>
  <li>Grouping edicts to automatically generate and configure diverse applications. 
  </li>
  <li>Finally, from each configuration one can launch a general application program 
    that is automatically configured and specialized for a particular model. When 
    the scientist using this program has made any final "tweaks" to the model, 
    a click of a "Run" button causes the automatic writing, compilation, and execution 
    of a computer program to run the simulation. </li>
</ul>
