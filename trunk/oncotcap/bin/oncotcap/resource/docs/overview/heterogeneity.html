<p>It is widely acknowledged that tumor heterogeneity is a central problem in 
  finding effective cancer treatments and in treating individuals. Intra-tumor 
  heterogeneity means that the cancer cells in one patient&#8217;s tumor differ, 
  not only from other patients&#8217; cancer cells, but also from each other. 
  Genetic heterogeneity within a tumor stems from poor control of replication. 
  It leads to subpopulations of cancer cells that are resistant to drug treatments. 
  Spatial heterogeneity stems from the invasion of tissues locally and also systemically 
  (metastasis). This leads to cancer cells that cannot be removed by surgery. 
  The tumor heterogeneity idea is prevalent, but paradoxically its role in anti-cancer 
  developmental activities is limited. For example, amidst today&#8217;s popularity 
  of genomic and proteomic investigations the study of patients&#8217; cancer 
  cells as individuals is uncommon. The most popular techniques, microarrays and 
  mass spectrometry, make measurements on samples, which have been disrupted and 
  homogenized. (There are important exceptions in which cancer cells from clinical 
  specimens are assayed as individuals, revealing a story that cannot be told 
  by homogenized samples.) While these techniques hold great promise, they also 
  tend to obscure the view that the story of the individual cancer cell is fundamental. 
  Therefore, there is a continuing need to bring an understanding of tumor heterogeneity 
  into the consciousness of those entering cancer research. </p>
