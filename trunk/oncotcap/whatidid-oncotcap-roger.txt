Using TcapData-Roger  (soft-linked)

I corrected the OncoType DX code.
RiskGroup action had never been completed.
Works now.

Looking at the example that runs SPlus code,
there is reference to a splus jars.
So to adapt to R, we'll probably have to use RJava.

In the DEMO Ba apoptosis boolean tree,
the last statement has an error in the java code.
If ___ is true then the mitosis rate is changed by ____.

The statement that begins "NOT WORKING" seems to be working.

There are 24 errors like this on startup:
java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: outputScreens
But it doesn't seem to hurt anything.

Running DEMO GoldieColdman:
In Drug X as episodic treatment,
compiler cannot find ranmarInstance

Made corrections for the MC TEST event sequences.
Must have  String message = "`event`";
Declaration and assignment must be combined,
and the doublequotes are necessary too.
Still not running: the error is
rglist: [Ljava.lang.Object;@49b09e06 length=0
java.lang.NullPointerException

	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)

Also, upon saving the KB, we get 8 copies of this error:
Error occured while accessing outputScreens in oncotcap.datalayer.persistible.ModelController check access it must be public


Convenience:  CMD-W should close a window.

the connection between detecting a "discourse" in a KN and our "Interpretation"...   could be useful!
