<h1>Scheduling Two Agents: The Goldie-Coldman Model and the Worst Drug Rule</h1>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable --> 
<hr>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="OverviewBody" --> 
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Jim Goldie and Andy Coldman proposed a branching process model for the following 
  situation: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Two anti-cancer agents (A and B, say).</li>
  <li>Four types of cancer cells: <br>
    (S=sensitive to both agents, RA=resistant only to A, RB=resistant only to 
    B, RAB=resistant to both)</li>
  <li>The two agents are &quot;symmetric&quot;: <br>
    A and B have equal potency on the cells which are sensitive to them, the corresponding 
    mutation rates to resistance are the same, and so on. </li>
  <li>Mutation processes can change S cells to RA or RB cells, and RA or RB cells 
    to RAB cells.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggestions for exploring this model</h2>
<p> <em>(The best way to explore these issues is with <a href="http://www.oncotcap.pitt.edu" title="OncoTCap Version 2">OncoTCap 
  Version 2</a>, which provides exact calculations of the probability of zero 
  cells after treatment, and integrates these exact calculations with stochastic 
  simulation. See the next section below.)</em></p>
<p>First, run the model as provided. The parameters are &quot;symmetric&quot;; 
  the two drugs A and B have equal potency on the cells which are sensitive to 
  them, the corresponding mutation rates to resistance are the same, and so on. 
  The alternating schedule provides the best chance of removing all the cancer 
  cells. Set up a sequential schedule, e.g <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  A A A A A A B B B B B B.<br>
  There will be cases in which the sequential schedule fails to eliminate cells 
  because cells resistant to A grow out unchecked.<br>
  Compare this with an alternating schedule<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
  B A B A B A B A B A B.<br>
  In this case, both RA and RB sub-populations are controlled, and in some cases 
  eliminated.<br>
  <em>(In Version 2, this comparison is easier to do, since a simulation can be 
  re-started with the same random number &quot;seed&quot; but a different treatment 
  schedule. Unlike in real life, one gets to take both forks of the road and see 
  where each goes. In time, this and other features will be migrated to the new 
  Version. ) </em></p>
<p>Second, change the cell kill parameters so that agent A become much more potent 
  (logkill = 2) and B much less potent (logkill = 1/2) . Again, begin with the 
  sequential schedule. Starting with the &quot;best drug&quot; A may seem entirely 
  reasonable. Observing a number of simulations, you will find this schedule to 
  be entirely unsuccessful. Instead try starting with the &quot;worst drug&quot; 
  B:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B 
  B B B B B A A A A A A.</p>
<h2>Further information about the Goldie-Coldman model and the Worst Drug Rule</h2>
<p>Principles discovered using the OncoTCap Version 2 <em>&quot;N</em>=&infin; 
  &nbsp;engine (exact calculation) can be viewed to operate in specific patient 
  histories to gain better insight. For example, consider the two-drug scenario. 
  From the exact solution, the probability of killing all tumor cells is calculated 
  for various treatment strategies: <br>

<p><strong>Figure 1: OncoTCap 2, probabilities of killing all cancer cells for 
  16 treatment schedules<br>
  </strong></p>
<p>Here the cure probability show that, although &#8220;a&#8221; is twice as potent 
  as &#8220;b&#8221;, the best schedules favor either &#8220;b&#8221; early (right 
  side of middle row) or more total &#8220;b&#8221; (bottom of left side). To 
  understand this, it helps to interact with a stochastic simulation. In the following 
  OncoTCap 2 screen shot, the dynamics of tumor heterogeneity and selection can 
  be seen.</p>

  <strong>Figure 2: OncoTCap 2, stochastic simulation</strong></p>
<p>Here dragging the fourth treatment from &#8220;Better Agent&#8221; to &#8220;Worse 
  Agent&#8221; leads to a cure, and the graphic makes it obvious why: the fourth 
  &#8220;Better Agent&#8221; does not kill the cells which will shortly give rise 
  to the doubly resistant subpopulation.<br>
  The &#8220;worst drug rule&#8221; principle continues to be discussed in regard 
  to lung cancer. However, to apply this principle directly requires good evidence 
  for the basic premise, that drug resistance stems from somatic mutation, and 
  some confidence that some critical biology has not been omitted.<br>
  <br>
  Version 2 is limited by its highly structured representation of the biology 
  and by the absence of support for model-building for particular settings like 
  treatment of advance non-small cell lung cancer or breast cancer.<br>
